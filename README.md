# Justin 'ZenMnky' Hager

Adept and versatile, I am experienced in business and program development, organizational leadership, and management of operations, policies and standards. I have 7+ years of combined experience as a leader and coach in the not for profit & health and fitness industries. 

Involved in web application development since December 2019, I bring creative solutions, organization, and collaboration. I specialize in designing and building solutions and processes from the ground up to support an organizationâ€™s objectives, managing solution lifecycles from conceptualization thru operationalization.   

I am now seeking to contribute my experience and expertise to a software development project in Portland, Oregon or remotely.
