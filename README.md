📍 👨‍💻  **What am I up to right now in the tech domain?**
- **Exploring unix and [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/)**: 
    - Set up a headless raspberry pi on my wireless network just as an initial learning project

    - Set up a linux virtual machine that I'm using as my JAMstack dev environment

        - I start simple and focus on progressive enhancement, learning as I go.

        - I have two primary real-world mini-projects (blogs) that I'm using to get familiar with all this: [JustinHager.blog](https://justinhager.blog/) & [JustinLexiAcro.yoga](https://justinlexiacro.yoga/)

        
        - Things on my list to explore/practice further: [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Agility CMS](https://agilitycms.com/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)


- **Finishing up a fullstack software dev program through Thinkful**
    - Expected certification date: 2021.03.11

- **Looking to make a break-in to the tech field and find out how I can best contribute**
    - I've recently begun to consider that my skills could be well applied as a liaison between a tech team and other stakeholders. Pretty similar to my role as program coordinator for a University's personal training program, similar to work I've done with a non-profit, and similar to work I've done as a personal trainer and health coach

     - Initial stages in volunteering to help with [Life Church's Open Network](https://open.life.church/) software engineering team

🎓 **Educational background**: 
- CISCO networking vocational program in highschool, started out college in a computer science program with aims of being a software developer, developed a fear that my life would be like 'Office Space', switched to philosophy with intentions of studying the foundations of CBT, dropped out and wrestled with an existential crisis for many years, went back to college and focused on Public Health and Health Sciences.
